Name: Responsive Portfolio

Description: This is my first coding portfolio. I included a Home page where my About me can be found. I included a Portfolio page where my projects can be seen. I also added a Contact page for companies or collaborators to contact me. I used Bootstrap, HTML and CSS to build out this web page.

My motivation for creating this web page was to show potential employers who I am personally and what I am capable of as a coder.
