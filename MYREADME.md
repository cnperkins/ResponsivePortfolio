Name: Responsive Portfolio

Description: This is my first coding portfolio. I included a Home page where my About me can be found. I included a Portfolio page where my projects can be seen. I also added a Contact page for companies or collaborators to contact me. I used Bootstrap and HTML to build out this web page.

My motivation for creating this web page was to show potential employers who I am personally and what I am capable of as a coder.

Here is a live link to my portfolio. https://cnperkins.github.io/ResponsivePortfolio/ 8/3/2020.

Thank you for checking out my portfolio!
